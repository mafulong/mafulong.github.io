I've studied English throughout my entire school years, yet I still sometimes struggle to grasp what native English speakers say. The difference between textbook English and the English spoken in daily life is significant. In everyday conversations, practices like sound reduction, linking words, and blending are common, yet school teachers often overlook these topics. Thankfully, numerous English learning channels on YouTube address these crucial aspects. Among them, Zahara English stands out as the best, not just one of the best. This channel is underrated and deserves more than 1 million subscribers. Zahara, your efforts are greatly appreciated. Please continue your excellent work. I'm eagerly looking forward to seeing the channel's subscriber count surpass a significant milestone soon.
