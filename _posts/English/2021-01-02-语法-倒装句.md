谓语部分完全放在主语之前的句子,便是**完全倒装句**。

代词比如you，he, she等

Here you are.给你。 (代词作主语, 不倒装)

There goes (the bell for break).下课铃响了。

Now comes your turn! 现在该你了!

Up went the arrow into the air.箭直射向空中。

Behind the counter he stood. 他站在柜台后面。 (代词作主语, 不倒装)

Inside the parcel was a letter.包裹里有封信。

Such were his words.( = Such was what he said.)这就是他说的话。



把 be 动词、助动词或情态动词置于主语之前的句子**叫部分倒装句**。 

**Only in this way can we learn** English well.

**Only he can** answer the question.只有他能回答这个问题。

**Not** a single mistake **did he make**. = He didn't make a single mistake.

So clearly **does he speak** English **that** he can always make himself understood.在这个句型中, so, such 后面的句子要倒装, 而 that 引导的从句不倒装。

Such an interesting book **does he have that** we all want to read it.在这个句型中, so, such 后面的句子要倒装, 而 that 引导的从句不倒装。

Neither **do I know** it, nor **do I care about** it.

Not only **will help be** given to people to find jobs, but also medical treatment will be provided for people who need it.
