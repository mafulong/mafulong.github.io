## 容易错误的

### looks like vs seems like

后者抽象，前者是物理看见

Both are very similar. 

-"It looks like" is something you usually say when you can physically see something. 

-"It seems like" is something a little more abstract. It's something you can only "detect" or guess at. 

 Examples: -"it seems like it will rain" -"it looks like it will rain" (these are both okay to say)  

-"It seems like just yesterday I was in high school" (you can't say "It looks like just yesterday I was in high school" because you can't physically "see" how much time has passed)



like作为像时是介词，可以直接加宾语，同as。只有当like作为句子主要成分，如He is like a dog. 也可以说成，He looks like a dog.

### ever怎么用

ever用作副词，意为“曾经、以前、无论何时、总是”等。其用法比较灵活

一、用于一般疑问句，意为“曾经、这以前”现代汉语中一般不译出。  
Does she ever go out at night？她通常晚上外出吗？  
Have you ever been to Beijing？你曾去过北京吗？  

二、用于否定句，意为“无论何时都不……，至今不曾……”。  
Nothing ever happens in the lonely village．这个遥远的小村子至今未出过事。  
We hardly ever go shopping there．我们至今未在那里买过东西。  

三、用于条件句，译为“曾经、有机会”。  
If you ever come to Beijing，please let me know．如果有机会来北京，请告诉我。  
If you ever have any problems，please call me．你若有问题，请打电话。

四、与比较级连用，译为“以前、以往、任何时候”。  
It is raining hard than ever．雨下得比以前更大了。  

五、与最高级连用，译为“空前、有史以来、从来没有”。  
I think she is the best actress ever．我认为她是至今最优秀的演员。  

六、与疑问词连用，加强语气，译为“到底、究竟”。  
When（where）ever did you see the panda？你到底在什么时候（哪里）看见那只熊猫的？  

七、口语中，用于带有be的疑问句加重语气，表感叹。  
Is she ever a beauty？她真漂亮！  

### 也

same sth as sth 不要用with。 the same as sth

same for me 我也要一样的

same here = me too. 我也一样 否定No, me neither

same to you 你也一样

It's same with her. 她也一样

neither do I.  我也不是

So do I 我也是

### Going on

 What’s going on? 发生了什么？

What’s going on?和what is happening?有相同的意思



go on

1. go on （doing something）： 继续（做某事）
2. go on （with something）：继续（某事）



1. The work is going on smoothly. 

   工作正在顺利进行。
