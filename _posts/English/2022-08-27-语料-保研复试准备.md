##  SCI paper

参与式感知激励机制算法研究 为了解决参与式感知中所收集数据在时间、空间上的分布不均而导致数据质量降低，提出一种考虑数据时空分布的激励机制，并在此机制中提出两种算法，第一种算法在数据收集总量满足需求的情况下最优化收集数据在时空上的分布，提高收集数据质量，第二种激励算法在第一种激励算法的基础上考虑总成本的降低，对多目标加权平均，同时降低总成本和优化收集数据在时空上的分布，并将这两种激励算法与固定价格的激励算法的结果进行对比，使用了Matlab, visio及Origin等编程及作图。题目为《A Time and Location Correlation Incentive Scheme for Deeply Data Gathering in Crowdsourcing Networks》

As the first author, I published a SCI paper with the title 《A Time and Location Correlation Incentive Scheme for Deeply Data Gathering in Crowdsourcing Networks》，the main content is about the incentive mechanism of participatory sensing. In this paper, two algorithms are proposed to solve the problem of uneven distribution of sensed data in time and space. I mainly use matlab, origin, visio. Lastly, it is about twenty-two pages.

We use a new metrics to measure the value of data in distribution dimension which the former paper lost. 

Dynamic and Greedy.

It's about the incentive mechanism of participatory sensing, which is study that how to make people to help platform to get the most valuable sensing data by their smartphone with least cost, such as paying money or virtual money to people, yeah, rewarding the participated people

Here's the question, what is the most valuable sensing data and how to judge it. 

We used a new metrics to measure the value of data in distribution dimension of time and space, which the former papers lost.

In this paper, two algorithms are proposed to solve this problem.

On the basis of meeting the requirements of Platform that geting enough sensed data, the first algorithm is maximize the the new metrics that I just mentioned by adjusting the rewards dynamically with a greedy algorithm. The second algorithm is to minimize the cost of the system while meeting the sensing data requirement and maximizing the new metrics. 

Finally, we compare our proposed scheme with existing schemes via extensive simulations. Extensive simulation results well justify the effectiveness of our scheme. 

I mainly use matlab, origin, visio. Lastly, it is about twenty-two pages.



## 你认为最重要的学科是什么

What do you think is the most important subject?

《数据结构》主要介绍如何合理地组织数据、有效地存储和处理数据，正确地设计算法以及对算法的分析与评价。用计算机解决实际问题，首先要做的事情就是要把涉及问题的相关信息存储到计算机中，也就是需要把问题的信息表示为计算机可接受的数据形式，然后根据问题处理功能的要求，对存储到计算机中的数据进行处理。归结为一句话，用计算机解题首先要用合理的结构表示数据，然后才能根据相应的算法处理结构，而数据表示和数据处理正是数据结构学科要研究的内容。

"Data Structure" mainly introduces how to organize data reasonably, efficiently store and process data, correctly design algorithms and analyze and evaluate algorithms. To solve practical problems with a computer, the first thing to do is to store the relevant information about the problem in the computer, that is, to represent the information of the problem as a form of data acceptable to the computer, and then to store the information according to the requirements of the problem processing function. Process the data into the computer. It comes down to one sentence. Solving a problem with a computer first requires a reasonable structure to represent the data, and then the structure can be processed according to the corresponding algorithm. Data representation and data processing are the contents of the data structure discipline.

## 除了四六级证书外你还有其他证书么

目前我英语方面我只有英语四六级证书，但是我打算在大四学习英语，考托福或者雅思，因为在半年前我撰写并发表了我的第一篇SCI论文，大概22页，接近两万多字，我认识到了英语的重要性，无论是英文写作还是阅读外文文献

At present, I only have English CET-6 certificate in English, but I plan to study English in the senior year, test TOEFL or IELTS, because I wrote and published my first SCI paper six months ago, about 22 pages, close to 20,000. Multi-word, I realized the importance of English, whether it is writing in English or reading foreign literature.

## 你如何证明你的英语能力

正如我刚才所说，在半年前我撰写并发表了我的第一篇SCI论文，大概22页，接近两万多字，论文是研究参与式感知中的激励机制的，并且我也阅读了大量相关的文献，这体现了我的英文阅读和写作能力。在平时的开发中，我也经常接触英语，比如Java开发的API文档，日志信息，同时我在leetcode平台上刷题超过200道，题目都是英文的，我认识到了英语重要性，想在接下来的一年考取托福雅思，更想到哈工大继续学习，希望老师给我这样一个机会。

As I said just now, I wrote and published my first SCI paper six months ago, about 22 pages, close to more than  twenty thousand words. The paper is about the incentive mechanism in participatory perception, and I also read a lot. Related literature, which reflects my English reading and writing skills. In the usual development, I also often contact English, such as Java development API documentation, log information, and I brushed more than 200 words on the leetcode platform, the topics are in English, I realized the importance of English, want to pick up In the coming year, I took TOEFL IELTS and thought that Harbin Institute of Technology would continue to study. I hope the teacher will give me such an opportunity.

 

## 学校

Central South University is located in Changsha, Hunan Province. It is a 985 university and it was founded in 2000. The former principal was Zhang Yuxue. The current principal of the school is Tian Hongqi. The school motto is practical, and there are several campuses, such as the headquarters, the new campus, and the railway campus. Behind the Yuelu Mountain, there is a beautiful scenery, as well as the Swan Lake, there are many white swan black swan, and even some TV dramas are also filmed in our school. Compared with other places in the school, I prefer to eat and live in the school. In terms of eating, there are many canteens, and the dishes are so many and cheap, which is full of praise. About the school’s living, in terms of the undergraduate. There are four students in a dormitory with air conditioning and a separate bathroom. The school encourages competition and innovation, and has established many related competitions. The participation of students is also very high. In a word, I like my university very much. Here, I have laid a solid foundation for my study. Ok. That’s all. Thank you.

 

## 家乡

I come from Linjiang City of Jilin Province, which is in the northeast of China. Linjiang is named for the Yalu River. The another side of the Yalu River is North Korea. Therefore, there are rich water resources because of the yalu river. There are also some beautiful scenery, famous attractions such as Jinyinxia, Xianren Cave, and so on. The population here is small, but people are very easy-going. In addition, compare with other cities, the prices of the city are very low, even no subways. When I was in high school, I went to another place. To some extent, it is another hometown. In Jiangyuan District of Baishan City, which is the hometown of black fungus in China, the hometown of Songhua Stone in Jiangyuan District, you may find special stones in the mountains. There is also a stone pavilion that exhibits a wide variety of stones and corresponding prices. These two places are located in the eastern part of Jilin Province, so the winter is long, cold, and the frost comes early. I really like my hometown and I hope my hometown can get better. OK. That’s all. Thank you.

 

## 家庭

I come from Linjiang City, Jilin Province. There are 4 people in my family. My parents and my sister, my sister is now married who is 9 years older than me. She has a daughter and even her daughter already in the first grade. My parents don't have a high diploma, making a living by selling fish. Compared with that my father is very strict with me, my mother is very gentle to me. Anyway, I am very grateful to my parents. OK. That’s all. Thank you.

## 爱好

  I have many hobbies, such as swimming, playing tennis, reading, Watching American TV and running in the night. I think hobbies can make my life colorful. Besides, having some hobbies can bring knowledge to me. For example, reading is a good way to get knowledge. So I also like to get knowledge in the library, but not what I learned in class. A book I read recently is 《java concurrency》. I can not learn all from class, so reading can bring me other knowledge. They can help me to improve myself. I spend the most time watching American TV. The American dramas I have seen include Old Friends, How I meet your mother, Big Bang, Little Shelton, Agent Carter, SHIELD Agent, Game of Thrones, Broke Girls. OK. That’s all. Thank you.
