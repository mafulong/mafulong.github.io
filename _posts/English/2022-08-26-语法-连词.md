## 连词



## 不仅而且Not only but also

[参考](https://en-grammar.xiao84.com/201612/27635.html)

比较自由。also可省略， but also之间也可以加词。

可连接主语、谓语动词...

The Americans and the British **not only** speak the same language **but also** share a large number of social customs.



Note:

- ”not only A but also B”结构中的A和B通常是同等成分。因此这句话是错误的“He not only plays the piano, but also the violin.” 可以改成“He plays **not only** the piano, but also the violin”

## 也(too, as well, also, either)

too和as well两者都可用在肯定句或疑问句的句末。两者通常可以换用。

She likes pizza as well.

=She likes pizza too.



-also:常在**肯定句句中**
-too:常在**肯定句句末**，前面常有逗号
-either:常在**否定句句末**
