This time, you are supposed to find A+B where A and B are two polynomials.

Input

Each input file contains one test case. Each case occupies 2 lines, and each line contains the information of a polynomial: K N1 a~N1~ N2 a~N2~ ... NK a~NK~, where K is the number of nonzero terms in the polynomial, Ni and a~Ni~ (i=1, 2, ..., K) are the exponents and coefficients, respectively. It is given that 1 <= K <= 10ï¼Œ0 <= NK < ... < N2 < N1 <=1000.

Output

For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input. Notice that there must be NO extra space at the end of each line. Please be accurate to 1 decimal place.
	
	Sample Input
	
	2 1 2.4 0 3.2
	2 2 1.5 1 0.5

	Sample Output
	
	3 2 1.5 1 2.9 0 3.2

## solution


```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
	float c[1001] = { 0 };
	int m, n, t;
	float num;
	scanf("%d", &m);
	for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
		scanf("%d%f", &t, &num);
		c[t] += num;
	}
	scanf("%d", &n);
	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		scanf("%d%f", &t, &num);
		c[t] += num;
	}
	int cnt = 0;
	for (int i = 0; i < 1001; i++) {
		if (c[i] != 0) cnt++;
	}
	printf("%d", cnt);
	for (int i = 1000; i >= 0; i--) {
		if (c[i] != 0)
			printf(" %d %.1f", i, c[i]);
	}
	return 0;
}
