## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-common-supersequence/)

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences. If multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.

*(A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of characters from T (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen anywhere from T) results in the string S.)*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
Output: "cabac"
Explanation: 
str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".
str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".
The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
2. `str1` and `str2` consist of lowercase English letters.


## solution

```python
class Solution:
    def shortestCommonSupersequence(self, str1: str, str2: str) -> str:
        n1, n2 = len(str1), len(str2)
        dp = [[""] * (n2 + 1) for _ in range(n1 + 1)]
        for i in range(1, n1 + 1):
            for j in range(1, n2 + 1):
                if str1[i - 1] == str2[j - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + str1[i - 1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1], key=len)
        lcs = dp[n1][n2]
        res = ""
        i, j = 0, 0
        for c in lcs:
            while str1[i] != c:
                res += str1[i]
                i += 1
            while str2[j] != c:
                res += str2[j]
                j += 1
            res += c
            i+=1
            j+=1
        res = res + str1[i:] + str2[j:]
        return res
```
