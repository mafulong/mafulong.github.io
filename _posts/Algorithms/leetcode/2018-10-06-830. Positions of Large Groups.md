## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/positions-of-large-groups/description/)

In a string S of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like S = "abbxxxxzyy" has the groups "a", "bb", "xxxx", "z" and "yy".

Call a group large if it has 3 or more characters.  We would like the starting and ending positions of every large group.

The final answer should be in lexicographic order.

 
	
	Example 1:
	
	Input: "abbxxxxzzy"
	Output: [[3,6]]
	Explanation: "xxxx" is the single large group with starting  3 and ending positions 6.
	Example 2:
	
	Input: "abc"
	Output: []
	Explanation: We have "a","b" and "c" but no large group.
	Example 3:
	
	Input: "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
	Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]

## solution
统计连续最长字符的start, end

```c++
static int Static_X = [](){
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    return 0;
}();
class Solution {
public:
	vector<vector<int>> largeGroupPositions(string S) {
		string s = S+'#';
		vector<vector<int>> res;
		int count = 1;
		int start = 0, end = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < s.length()-1; i++) {
			if (s[i] == s[i + 1]) {
				if (count == 1)
					start = i;
				count++;
			}
			else {
				if (count >= 3) {
					res.push_back({ start,i });
				}
				count = 1;
			}
		}
		return res;
	}
};

```
