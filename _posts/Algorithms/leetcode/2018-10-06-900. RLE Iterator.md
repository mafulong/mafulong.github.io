## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/rle-iterator/description/)

Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by RLEIterator(int[] A), where A is a run-length encoding of some sequence.  More specifically, for all even i, A[i] tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value A[i+1] is repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function: next(int n), which exhausts the next n elements (n >= 1) and returns the last element exhausted in this way.  If there is no element left to exhaust, next returns -1 instead.

For example, we start with A = [3,8,0,9,2,5], which is a run-length encoding of the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].  This is because the sequence can be read as "three eights, zero nines, two fives".

 

Example 1:

	Input: ["RLEIterator","next","next","next","next"], [[[3,8,0,9,2,5]],[2],[1],[1],[2]]
	Output: [null,8,8,5,-1]
	Explanation: 
	RLEIterator is initialized with RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]).
	This maps to the sequence [8,8,8,5,5].

RLEIterator.next is then called 4 times:

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [8, 5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 8.  The remaining sequence is now [5, 5].

.next(1) exhausts 1 term of the sequence, returning 5.  The remaining sequence is now [5].

.next(2) exhausts 2 terms, returning -1.  This is because the first term exhausted was 5,
but the second term did not exist.  Since the last term exhausted does not exist, we return -1

## solution


```c++
class RLEIterator {
public:
	int i, q;
	vector<int> A;
	RLEIterator(vector<int> A) {
		this->A = A;
		i = 0;
		q = 0;
	}

	int next(int n) {
		while (i < A.size()) {
			if (n + q > A[i]) {
				n -= A[i]-q;
				q = 0;
				i += 2;
			}
			else {
				q += n;
				return A[i + 1];
			}

		}
		return -1;
	}
};

```
