## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/description/)

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

Example:

	Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
	Output: 4 

Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
 
Note:

There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

## solution
DP

O(n2)

还可以优化的，但是我没看懂

```c++

class Solution {
public:
	int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
		int n = nums.size();
		int ans = 0;
		int *dp = new int[n + 1];
		fill(dp, dp + n + 1, 1);
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
				if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
					dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
				}
			}
			ans = max(ans, dp[i]);
		}
		return ans;
	}
};
```
