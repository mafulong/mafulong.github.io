## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/)

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

**Notice** that you may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= k <= 109`
- `0 <= prices.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`


## solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(prices)
        # corner case
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        # main part
        dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            max_diff = float('-inf')
            for j in range(1, n):
                max_diff = max(max_diff, (dp[i - 1][j - 2] if j >= 2 else 0) - prices[j - 1])
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], prices[j] + max_diff)
        return dp[k][n - 1]

```
