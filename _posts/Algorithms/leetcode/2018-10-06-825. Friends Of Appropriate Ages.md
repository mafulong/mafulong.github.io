## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages/description/)

Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and ages[i] is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

- age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7
- age[B] > age[A]
- age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100

Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A.  Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

	Example 1:
	
	Input: [16,16]
	Output: 2
	Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
	Example 2:
	
	Input: [16,17,18]
	Output: 2
	Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
	Example 3:
	
	Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
	Output: 
	Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
 

Notes:

- 1 <= ages.length <= 20000.
- 1 <= ages[i] <= 120.

## solution
累计每个age的count, 遍历age, count[i]*count[j]

```c++
static int Static_X = [](){
    std::ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);
    return 0;
}();
class Solution {
public:
	int numFriendRequests(vector<int>& ages) {
		int count[121] = { 0 };
		for (auto it : ages) {
			count[it]++;
		}
		int res = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i <= 120; i++) {
			for (int j = 1; j <= 120; j++) {
				if (0.5*i+7>=j) continue;
				if (i < j) continue;
				if (j>100&&i<100) continue;
				res += count[i] * count[j];
				if (i == j)
					res -= count[i];
			}
		}
		return res;
	}
};

```
