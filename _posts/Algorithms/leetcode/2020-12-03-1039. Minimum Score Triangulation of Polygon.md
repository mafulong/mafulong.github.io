## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-score-triangulation-of-polygon/)

Given `N`, consider a convex `N`-sided polygon with vertices labelled `A[0], A[i], ..., A[N-1]` in clockwise order.

Suppose you triangulate the polygon into `N-2` triangles. For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the **product** of the labels of the vertices, and the *total score* of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all `N-2` triangles in the triangulation.

Return the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon.

 



**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [3,7,4,5]
Output: 144
Explanation: There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 + 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.  The minimum score is 144.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [1,3,1,4,1,5]
Output: 13
Explanation: The minimum score triangulation has score 1*1*3 + 1*1*4 + 1*1*5 + 1*1*1 = 13.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `3 <= A.length <= 50`
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 100`


## solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minScoreTriangulation(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [[0] * 50 for _ in range(50)]

        def f(i=0, j=0):
            if j == 0:
                j = len(A) - 1
            if dp[i][j] != 0:
                return dp[i][j]
            if i != len(A) - 1 and i >= j - 1:
                return 0
            res = sys.maxsize
            for k in range(i + 1, j):
                res = min(res, f(i, k) + A[i] * A[k] * A[j] + f(k, j))
            dp[i][j] = res
            return res

        f(0, len(A) - 1)
        return dp[0][len(A) - 1]

```
