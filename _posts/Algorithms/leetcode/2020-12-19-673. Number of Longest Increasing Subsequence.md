## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence/)

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the number of longest increasing subsequences.*

**Notice** that the sequence has to be **strictly** increasing.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
- `-106 <= nums[i] <= 106`


## solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findNumberOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        N = len(nums)
        lengths = [1] * (N)
        count = [1] * (N)
        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            for j in range(i):
                if v > nums[j]:
                    if lengths[i] < lengths[j] + 1:
                        lengths[i] = lengths[j] + 1
                        count[i] = count[j]
                    elif lengths[i] == lengths[j] + 1:
                        count[i] += count[j]
        max_len = max(lengths)
        return sum(c for i, c in enumerate(count) if lengths[i] == max_len)

```
