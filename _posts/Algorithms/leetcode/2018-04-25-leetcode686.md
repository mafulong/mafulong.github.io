## Title
[the problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-string-match/description/)

Given two strings A and B, find the minimum number of times A has to be repeated such that B is a substring of it. If no such solution, return -1.

For example, with A = "abcd" and B = "cdabcdab".

Return 3, because by repeating A three times (“abcdabcdabcd”), B is a substring of it; and B is not a substring of A repeated two times ("abcdabcd").

Note:
The length of A and B will be between 1 and 10000.

## Solution
```c++
//cpp:
class Solution {
public:
	int repeatedStringMatch(string A, string B) {
		int q = 0;
		string s = "";
		while (s.length() < B.length()) {
			s += A;
			q++;
		}

		if (s.find(B)!=-1) {
			return q;
		}
		if (s.append(A).find(B) != -1)
			return q + 1;
		return -1;
	}
};
```

Approach #1: Ad-Hoc [Accepted]
Intuition

The question can be summarized as "What is the smallest k for which B is a substring of A * k?" We can just try every k.

Algorithm

Imagine we wrote S = A+A+A+.... If B is to be a substring of S, we only need to check whether some S[0:], S[1:], ..., S[len(A) - 1:] starts with B, as S is long enough to contain B, and S has period at most len(A).

Now, suppose q is the least number for which len(B) <= len(A * q). We only need to check whether B is a substring of A * q or A * (q+1). If we try k < q, then B has larger length than A * q and therefore can't be a substring. When k = q+1, A * k is already big enough to try all positions for B; namely, A[i:i+len(B)] == B for i = 0, 1, ..., len(A) - 1.
