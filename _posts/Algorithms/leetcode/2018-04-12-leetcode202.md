## Title
[the problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/description/)

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number

题目大意：一个数的每位上的数字的平方和如果为1就是happy number,只要在这个循环中有1就可以了。

## Solution
```c++
//cpp:
class Solution {
public:

	bool isHappy(int n) {
		int t1, t2;
		unordered_set<int> uset;
		while (uset.find(n)==uset.end()) {
			uset.insert(n);
			t1 = 0;
			while (n > 0) {
				t2 = n % 10;
				t1 += t2*t2;
				n /= 10;
			}
			if (t1 == 1)
				return true;
			else
				n = t1;
		}
		return false;

	}
};
```
