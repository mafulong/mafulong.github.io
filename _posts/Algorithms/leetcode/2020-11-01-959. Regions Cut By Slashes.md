## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/regions-cut-by-slashes/)

n a N x N grid composed of 1 x 1 squares, each 1 x 1 square consists of a /, \, or blank space.  These characters divide the square into contiguous regions.

(Note that backslash characters are escaped, so a \ is represented as "\\".)

Return the number of regions.

    

    Example 1:

    Input:
    [
    " /",
    "/ "
    ]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

    Example 2:

    Input:
    [
    " /",
    "  "
    ]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

    Example 3:

    Input:
    [
    "\\/",
    "/\\"
    ]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "\\/" refers to \/, and "/\\" refers to /\.)
    The 2x2 grid is as follows:

    Example 4:

    Input:
    [
    "/\\",
    "\\/"
    ]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: (Recall that because \ characters are escaped, "/\\" refers to /\, and "\\/" refers to \/.)
    The 2x2 grid is as follows:

    Example 5:

    Input:
    [
    "//",
    "/ "
    ]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The 2x2 grid is as follows:

## solution

```python
class Solution:
    def regionsBySlashes(self, grid: List[str]) -> int:
        uf = {}

        def find(x):
            if uf[x] != x:
                uf[x] = find(uf[x])
            return uf[x]

        def union(a, b):
            uf.setdefault(a, a)
            uf.setdefault(b, b)
            uf[find(a)] = find(b)

        print("grid: ", grid)
        n = len(grid)

        def p(x, y):
            return (x, y)

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == "/":
                    union(p(i + 0.5, j), p(i, j + 0.5))
                    union(p(i + 1, j + 0.5), p(i + 0.5, j + 1))
                elif grid[i][j] == "\\":
                    union(p(i + 0.5, j), p(i + 1, j + 0.5))
                    union(p(i, j + 0.5), p(i + 0.5, j + 1))
                elif grid[i][j] == " ":
                    union(p(i + 0.5, j), p(i, j + 0.5))
                    union(p(i + 1, j + 0.5), p(i + 0.5, j + 1))
                    union(p(i + 0.5, j), p(i + 1, j + 0.5))
                    union(p(i, j + 0.5), p(i + 0.5, j + 1))
        count = len({find(x) for x in uf})
        print("count: ", count)
        return count
```
