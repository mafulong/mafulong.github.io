## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/)

We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose **any two rocks** and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are totally destroyed;
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y-x`.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left. Return the **smallest possible** weight of this stone (the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.)

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
2. `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`

## solution

```
/**
This question eaquals to partition an array into 2 subsets whose difference is minimal
(1) S1 + S2  = S
(2) S1 - S2 = diff  

==> -> diff = S - 2 * S2  ==> minimize diff equals to  maximize S2 

Now we should find the maximum of S2 , range from 0 to S / 2, using dp can solve this

dp[i][j]   = {true if some subset from 1st to j'th has a sum equal to sum i, false otherwise}
    i ranges from (sum of all elements) {1..n}
    j ranges from  {1..n}

same as 494. Target Sum

```

```python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        totalSum = sum(stones)
        dp = [False for _ in range(totalSum // 2 + 1)]
        dp[0] = True
        s2 = 0
        for stone in stones:
            for i in range(totalSum // 2, -1, -1):
                dp[i] = dp[i] or (dp[i - stone] if i >= stone else False)
                if dp[i]:
                    s2 = max(s2, i)
        return totalSum - 2 * s2

```
