## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/domino-and-tromino-tiling/)

We have two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino shape, and an "L" tromino shape. These shapes may be rotated.

```
XX  <- domino

XX  <- "L" tromino
X
```

Given N, how many ways are there to tile a 2 x N board? **Return your answer modulo 10^9 + 7**.

(In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.)

```
Example:
Input: 3
Output: 5
Explanation: 
The five different ways are listed below, different letters indicates different tiles:
XYZ XXZ XYY XXY XYY
XYZ YYZ XZZ XYY XXY
```

**Note:**

- N will be in range `[1, 1000]`.


## solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numTilings(self, N: int) -> int:
        # 1, 2, 3 = top, down, top&down
        memo = {}
        p = 10 ** 9 + 7

        def f(i, t):
            if (i, t) in memo:
                return memo[(i, t)]
            # corner case:
            if i <= 0:
                if i == 0 and t == 3:
                    return 1
                else:
                    return 0
            if t == 1:
                r = f(i - 2, 3)%p + f(i - 1, 2)%p
            elif t == 2:
                r = f(i - 2, 3)%p + f(i - 1, 1)%p
            else:
                r = f(i - 1, 3)%p + f(i - 1, 1)%p + f(i - 1, 2)%p + f(i - 2, 3)%p
            r = r % p
            memo[(i, t)] = r
            return r

        #
        # assert f(1, 3) == 1
        # assert f(1, 1) == f(1, 2) == 0
        # assert f(2, 1) == f(2, 2) == 1
        # assert f(2, 3) == 2

        return f(N, 3)
```
