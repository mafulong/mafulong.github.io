## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-palindromic-subsequences/)

Given a string `s` consisting only of letters `'a'` and `'b'`. In a single step you can remove one palindromic **subsequence** from `s`.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string, if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: String is already palindrome
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "". 
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` only consists of letters 'a' and 'b'

## solution

注意sequence不是subarray，同时只有ab两种字符，因此最多由两个回文sequence组成

```python
class Solution:
    def removePalindromeSub(self, s: str) -> int:
        if s=="":
            return 0
        elif s==s[::-1]:
            return 1
        else:
            return 2
```
