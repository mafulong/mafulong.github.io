## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/change-minimum-characters-to-satisfy-one-of-three-conditions/)

You are given two strings `a` and `b` that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in `a` or `b` to **any lowercase letter**.

Your goal is to satisfy **one** of the following three conditions:

- **Every** letter in `a` is **strictly less** than **every** letter in `b` in the alphabet.
- **Every** letter in `b` is **strictly less** than **every** letter in `a` in the alphabet.
- **Both** `a` and `b` consist of **only one** distinct letter.

Return *the **minimum** number of operations needed to achieve your goal.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = "aba", b = "caa"
Output: 2
Explanation: Consider the best way to make each condition true:
1) Change b to "ccc" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.
2) Change a to "bbb" and b to "aaa" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.
3) Change a to "aaa" and b to "aaa" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.
The best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = "dabadd", b = "cda"
Output: 3
Explanation: The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to "eee".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 105`
- `a` and `b` consist only of lowercase letters.


## solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minCharacters(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:
        la, lb = len(a), len(b)
        countA = defaultdict(int)
        countB = defaultdict(int)
        for i in a:
            countA[ord(i)] += 1
        for i in b:
            countB[ord(i)] += 1
        ans = float('inf')
        a1sum, b1sum = 0, 0
        for t in range(ord('a'), ord('z')):
            a1sum += countA[t]
            b1sum += countB[t]
            ans = min(ans, la - a1sum + b1sum, lb - b1sum + a1sum, la + lb - countA[t] - countB[t])
        # z的情况
        ans = min(ans, la+lb-countA[ord('z')] - countB[ord('z')])
        return ans
```
