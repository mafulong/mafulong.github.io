## title
[problem link](https://leetcode.com/problems/out-of-boundary-paths/)

There is an **m** by **n** grid with a ball. Given the start coordinate **(i,j)** of the ball, you can move the ball to **adjacent** cell or cross the grid boundary in four directions (up, down, left, right). However, you can **at most** move **N** times. Find out the number of paths to move the ball out of grid boundary. The answer may be very large, return it after mod 109 + 7.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 2, n = 2, N = 2, i = 0, j = 0
Output: 6
Explanation:
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 1, n = 3, N = 3, i = 0, j = 1
Output: 12
Explanation:
```

 

**Note:**

1. Once you move the ball out of boundary, you cannot move it back.
2. The length and height of the grid is in range [1,50].
3. N is in range [0,50].


## solution

```python

class Solution:
    def findPaths(self, m: int, n: int, N: int, i: int, j: int) -> int:
        dir = (-1, 0, 1, 0, -1)
        memo = {}
        p = 10**9+7

        def f(x, y, l):
            if (x,y,l) in memo:
                return memo.get((x,y,l))
            if x < 0 or x >= m or y < 0 or y >= n:
                return 1
            if l <= 0:
                return 0
            r = 0
            for k in range(4):
                r += f(x + dir[k], y + dir[k + 1], l - 1)
            r %= p
            memo[(x,y,l)] = r
            return r

        return f(i, j, N)

```
